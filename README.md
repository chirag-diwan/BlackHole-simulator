# BlackHole-simulator
this is my c++ project here i am simulating a blackhole , this code is highly optimised and it even works with my Pentium Dual core processor (takes around 1 min to render 1 frame)

the ugly polar singularities are because of the choice of coordinate system , you could use cartesian coordinate system(i used polar coordinates , just like schwarzschild did<highly efficient on system , belive me>) but the equations are highly gorss on paper let alone in code

this code has been made efficient specifically for intel processor(Pentium dual core) , you could make this even more fast and even realtime if you use opencv and upload the code to graphics card(i dont have one so i stuck to cpu processing) it would require you to make some changes to the code but it would work hella smooth , i also recommend using CUDA library if you have nvidia's graphics card.
